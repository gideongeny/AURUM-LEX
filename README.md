**Aurum & Lex** is a world-class, ultra-premium website designed for top-tier law firms dealing in Corporate Litigation, Private Wealth, and International Law. This project creates a bespoke digital presence that exudes authority, discretion, and excellence.

## 🏛️ Project Overview

This repository contains the complete source code for a custom-designed legal website. Unlike generic templates, **Aurum & Lex** features:

-   **"Silent Authority" Design System**: A custom CSS framework using Obsidian, Deep Navy, and Gold Foil colors.
-   **No External Frameworks**: Zero dependency on Bootstrap or jQuery. Built with modern, lightweight CSS Grid/Flexbox and Vanilla JS.
-   **Mobile-First Experience**: A responsive layout with a custom JavaScript-driven navigation drawer.
-   **SEO Optimized**: Includes Schema.org `LegalService` JSON-LD for maximum search engine visibility.
-   **High-End Animations**: Subtle glassmorphism and gold shimmer effects.

## 📂 Structure

-   `index.html`: The main single-page application structure.
-   `assets/css/style.css`: The "Silent Authority" design system (all styles).
-   `assets/images/`: Optimized assets for the hero and partner sections.
